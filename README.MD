# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe in Python. The game can be played by two players who take turns marking spots on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
